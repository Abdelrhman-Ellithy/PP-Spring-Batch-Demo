## Overview üåü

Spring Batch is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of scalable and resilient batch processing applications in Java. This repository demonstrates a method for importing files using batch jobs, emphasizing clarity and best practices.

## Batch Jobs Explained üîÑ

A **Batch Job** is the backbone of the entire process. It encapsulates a series of operations, enabling smooth coordination among different tasks. Jobs can be configured using XML or Java, offering flexibility and control over restart policies and error management.

## Steps Breakdown üìä

A **Step** represents a single phase in a batch job. Each step performs a specific task, such as reading data, transforming it, or writing the output. This modular design ensures that individual parts of the process can be managed and monitored independently.

## Job Instances üóÇÔ∏è

A **Job Instance** corresponds to a unique execution of a batch job. For example, running the same file import job daily will create a new Job Instance each day. This helps in tracking and managing the history of job executions.

### Example:
- Daily file import recorded as separate instances

---

## Job Executions üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A **Job Execution** captures the details of each attempt to run a Job Instance. Whether a job finishes successfully or encounters an error, each execution is logged separately, providing valuable insights for troubleshooting and auditing.

### Example:
- Initial execution of the daily job
- Retry after a failure, recorded as a distinct execution
